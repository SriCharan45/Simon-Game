## Simon Game

This is a simple implementation of the Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Simon game is a memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order. The game gradually becomes more challenging as players progress through the levels.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game starts at Level 1, and you will see the message "Press A Key to Start."
3. Press any key to start the game.
4. Pay attention to the sequence of colors and sounds that are displayed on the screen.
5. Click on the buttons with the corresponding colors to repeat the sequence.
6. If you get the sequence right, you'll move on to the next level.
7. If you make a mistake, you'll hear an error sound, and the game will display "Game Over." You can restart the game by pressing any key.
